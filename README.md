# OpenAI-x-Unity3D
This is a easy to use OpenAI Dalle-2 integration with Unity3D.

**How to use it?**

1. Clone the repository and open the project
2. Go into the 'Sample' scene and select the 'GenerateHere' GameObject. It will have two scripts attached. '**Generate**' : This handles the actual image generation. Type in a prompt and select the image size. And '**Dall E Generator**' : You need to add your OpenAI API Key here in order to connect to DallE. Find your key by making an account [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) and then go to User Settings. If you can't figure it out, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay0u4O6PoBE&ab_channel=MaxDalton) tutorial. 
3. Happy generating!

Please keep in mind that every generation is around 0.02$, sum that will be extracted from your OpenAI account.
